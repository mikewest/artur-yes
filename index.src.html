Introduction {#intro}
============

Cross-site scripting is a problem for developers. Despite the existence of context-aware escaping
mechanisms in templating systems, content injection continues to be one of of the most common
attack vectors.

Content Security Policy [[CSP]] aims to reduce the risk of these attacks, and is widely supported
by browsers. It has proven to be difficult to deploy, however, as the syntax is complicated, the
overriding rules are confused, and the feature itself serves several different purposes. Recent
research has shown flaws in real-world deployments result in policies that are ineffective at
directly preventing cross-site scripting in the overwhelming majority of cases [[CSP-IS-DEAD]].
That research, and related discussions, has lead to new approaches within CSP (like those
described in [[CSP3#strict-dynamic-usage]]) which seem promising, but the syntax ends up being
somewhat verbose and the behavior confusing due to backwards compatibility concerns.

This document proposes a policy language focused strictly on XSS protection, with the goal of
providing the same XSS mitigation guarantees as a verbose and complicated CSP, but in a pithy and
comprehensible package.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to defend against cross-site scripting. It can do so by generating a unique
  string for each page load, and including that string both in an <a http-header>`ARTUR`</a> header
  and in the <{script}> element's <{script/nonce}> attribute, as follows:

  <pre highlight="yaml">
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy" dictionary-member>nonce</a>": "<strong>abcdefg</strong>" }
  </pre>

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;!-- This script will execute. --&gt;
    &lt;script src="script.js" nonce="<strong>abcdefg</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;!-- This script won't (no nonce). --&gt;
    &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

Framework {#framework}
=========

This specification uses terminology from [[!RFC5234]] and [[!HTTP-JFV]] to define its syntax
expectations, and relies heavily on [[!CSP]] (which itself relies on [[FETCH]] and [[HTML]]) for
enforcement.

Policy {#policy}
------

An <dfn export>ARTUR policy</dfn> defines a set of behaviors which are to be applied to
a {{Window}} or {{WorkerGlobalScope}}.

Each policy has a <dfn for="ARTUR policy">nonce</dfn> which is a string. Its value is the
empty string unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="ARTUR policy">hash set</dfn> which is a set of strings. Its
value is the empty set unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="ARTUR policy">reporting disposition</dfn> which is either
"`enforce`" or "`report`". Its value is "`enforce`" unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="ARTUR policy">reporting group</dfn> which is a string. Its
value is the string "`default`" unless otherwise specified.

Each policy has a <dfn for="ARTUR policy">eval policy</dfn> which is either "`block`" or
"`unsafe-eval`". Its value is "`unsafe-eval`" unless otherwise specified.

Algorithms {#algorithms}
----------

<h4 algorithm id="policy-for-response">
  Obtain a set of ARTUR policies for |response|.
</h4>

Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm returns a sequence of <a>ARTUR policy</a>
objects. If no valid policy is found for |response|, the returned sequence will be empty.

1.  Let |policies| be an empty sequence.

2.  Let |value| be the result of <a lt="parse a header value">parsing</a>
    "<a http-header>`ARTUR`</a>" in |response|'s <a for="response">header list</a>.

3.  If |value| is `null`, return |policies|.

4.  Let |list| be the result of executing the algorithm defined in Section 4 of [[!HTTP-JFV]] on
    |value|. If that algorithm results in an error, return |policies|.

5.  For each |item| in |list|:

    1.  Let |policy| be a new <a>ARTUR policy</a>.

    2.  If |item| has a {{ArturPolicy/hash}} member whose value (|value|) is a
        `sequence<DOMString>`, then for each |digest| in |value|:
        
        1.  If |digest| matches the ABNF grammar
            <code><a grammar>hash-algorithm</a>-<a grammar>hash-source</a></code> (as defined in
            [[!CSP]]), then add |digest| to |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">hash set</a>.

    3.  If |item| has a {{ArturPolicy/nonce}} member whose value (|value|) is a
        `DOMString` that matches the ABNF grammar <a grammar>`base64-value`</a> (as defined in
        [[!CSP]]), then set |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">nonce</a> to |value|.

    5.  If |item| has a {{ArturPolicy/report}} member whose value (|value|) matches the
        <a grammar>`token`</a> grammar (as defined in [[!RFC7230]]), then set |policy|'s
        <a for="ARTUR policy">reporting group</a> to |value|.

    6.  If |item| has a {{ArturPolicy/eval}} member whose value (|value|) is a valid
        {{EvalPolicy}}, then set |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">eval policy</a> to
        |value|.

    7.  Append |policy| to |policies|.
    
6.  Return |policies|.


The `ARTUR` HTTP Response Header {#header}
=========================================

The <dfn export http-header>`ARTUR`</dfn> HTTP response header field is the delivery
mechanism for the mitigations this document offers. The header's value is a <dfn>serialized ARTUR
policy</dfn> represented by the following ABNF [[!RFC5234]]:

<pre>
  ARTUR = <a grammar>json-field-value</a>
</pre>

<div class="example">
  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "nonce": "abcdefg", "report": "group1" }
  </pre>

  This header will have more or less the same effect as delivering the following header:

  <pre>
    <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abcdegf';
                             object-src 'none';
                             report-to group1;
  </pre>
</div>

A server MAY send different `ARTUR` header field values with different representations of the same
resource.

The header's value is interpreted as an array of JSON objects, as described in Section 4 of
[[!HTTP-JFV]]. Detailed parsing instructions are found in [[#policy-for-response]], but the syntax
boils down to a representation of the following dictionary type:

<pre class="idl">
  enum EvalPolicy {
    "block",
    "unsafe-allow"
  };

  dictionary ArturPolicy {
    EvalPolicy eval = "unsafe-allow";
    sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; hash;
    DOMString nonce;
    DOMString report = "default";
    boolean reportOnly = false;
  };
</pre>

The following subsections define the behavior of each of the known members the header's value
defines. Future versions of this document may define additional members; user agents MUST ignore
unknown members when parsing the header.

The `eval` member {#eval-member}
-----------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="ArturPolicy">eval</dfn> member defines the page's policy towards
`eval()`. For increased security, developers can set the value to "`block`", which causes `eval()`
to throw a `SecurityError` rather than executing a string as code. It is set to "`unsafe-allow`"
by default in order to keep policies simple, as we've seen widespread-enough usage of `eval()` to
make it hard to deny by fiat.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. has a number of libraries which require `eval()` for various purposes. They can
  allow such execution by sending an appropriate {{ArturPolicy/eval}} member along with
  their ARTUR policy:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy">hash</a>": [ "<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>", "<strong>sha256-zyx...</strong>" ], "<a for="ArturPolicy">eval</a>": "unsafe-allow" }
  </pre>
</div>

The `hash` member {#hash-member}
-----------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="ArturPolicy">hash</dfn> member defines a set of digests
which specify specific script content which is allowed to execute on a given page.

If present, the member's value MUST be a sequence of {{DOMString}}s, and each MUST adhere to the
<a grammar>hash-source</a> grammar specified in [[CSP3#framework-directive-source-list]]. Any
item in the sequence that does not match that grammer MUST be ignored.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to ensure that injected <{script}> elements do not execute. They can do so
  by executing a secure hash function (like those specified in [[SHA2]]) on each script they wish to
  execute, and including the resulting list of digests in an <a http-header>`ARTUR`</a>
  header. These digests either match the inline content of a <{script}> element or event handler, or
  match a <{script}> element's <{script/integrity}> attribute:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy">hash</a>": [ "<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>", "<strong>sha256-zyx...</strong>" ] }

    ...

    &lt;script src="script.js" integrity="<strong>sha256-abcd...</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      // Content which hashes to `abcd...` goes here.
    &lt;/script&gt;
    
    &lt;a onclick="// Content which hashes to `zyx...` goes here."&gt;Click!&lt;/a&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

ISSUE(w3c/webappsec-csp#13): Matching inline event handlers requires some changes to CSP.

ISSUE(w3c/webappsec-csp#78): Matching external scripts requires solidifying CSP's SRI integration.

The `nonce` member {#nonce-member}
------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="ArturPolicy">`nonce`</dfn> member defines a cryptographic
nonce ("number used once") which can be used to ensure that only <{script}> elements whose
<{script/nonce}> attributes contain a specific value are allowed to execute script for a given page.

If present, the member's value MUST be a {{DOMString}}, and MUST adhere to the
<a grammar>base64-value</a> grammar specified in [[CSP3#framework-directive-source-list]]. If the
member's value does not match that grammar, the value MUST be ignored.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to ensure that injected <{script}> elements do not execute. They can do so
  by generating a unique string for each page load, and including that string both in an
  <a http-header>`ARTUR`</a> header and in the <{script}> element's <{script/nonce}>
  attribute, as follows:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy" dictionary-member>nonce</a>": "<strong>abcdefg</strong>" }

    ...

    &lt;script src="script.js" nonce="<strong>abcdefg</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
</div>

The `report` member {#report-member}
-------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="ArturPolicy">`report`</dfn> member defines the reporting
group to which violation reports will be sent [[REPORTING]].

The member's value MUST be a {{DOMString}}. If an empty string is provided, reporting will be
disabled.

Note: Reporting to the group named "`default`" is enabled unless otherwise specified.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to receive violation reports when script execution is blocked by the ARTUR
  policy it specifies. It can do so by sending a {{ArturPolicy/report}} member along with the
  policy, and specifying a reporting endpoint, as follows:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy" idl>nonce</a>": "abcdefg", "<a for="ArturPolicy" idl>report</a>": "group1" }
    <a http-header>Report-To</a>: { "<a spec="REPORTING">url</a>": "https://example.com/report", "<a spec="REPORTING">group</a>": "group1", "<a spec="REPORTING">max-age</a>": 10886400 }
  </pre>
</div>

The `reportOnly` member {#reportOnly-member}
-----------------------

The <dfn dictionary-member for="ArturPolicy">`reportOnly`</dfn> member defines whether the
policy specified will actually block script execution, or whether it will operate in "report-only"
mode, sending violation reports up to a server-side collector while allowing script execution.

<div class="example">
  MegaCorp, Inc. wishes to receive violation reports when script execution would be blocked by the
  ARTUR policy it specifies while it verifies that its nonce-generation code is working
  correctly. It can do so by sending {{ArturPolicy/report}} and
  {{ArturPolicy/reportOnly}} members along with the policy, and specifying a reporting
  endpoint, as follows:

  <pre>
    <a http-header>ARTUR</a>: { "<a for="ArturPolicy" idl>nonce</a>": "abcdefg", "<a for="ArturPolicy" idl>report</a>": "group1", "<a for="ArturPolicy">reportOnly</a>": true }
    <a http-header>Report-To</a>: { "<a spec="REPORTING">url</a>": "https://example.com/report", "<a spec="REPORTING">group</a>": "group1", "<a spec="REPORTING">max-age</a>": 10886400 }
  </pre>
</div>

Integrations {#integrations}
============

The <a http-header>`ARTUR`</a> header is little more than syntactic sugar on top of existing
processing algorithms for [[CSP]]. This section explains the ways in which the <a>ARTUR
policy</a> is enforced for a given context:

Integration with Fetch {#monkey-patching-fetch}
----------------------

1.  When executing [[csp3#set-response-csp-list]] (currently as step 3.3.4 of <a>HTTP fetch</a>, and
    step 12 of <a>HTTP-network fetch</a>), Fetch should also execute the algorithm defined in
    [[#set-response-csp-list]].

ISSUE: Upstream this once we decide it's sane.

<h4 algorithm id="set-response-csp-list">
  Populate |response|'s CSP list from its ARTUR policy.
</h4>

Given a <a>response</a> (|response|), this algorithm modifies its <a for="response">CSP list</a> to
enforce the <a>ARTUR policy</a> it specifies.

1.  For each |policy| in the result of executing [[#policy-for-response]] on |response|:

    1.  If |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">nonce</a> is an empty string and
        |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">hash set</a> is empty, then skip the remaining
        substeps and move to the next |policy|.

    2.  Assert: |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">nonce</a> is either an empty string or
        matches the <a grammar>base64-value</a> grammar specified in [[CSP]]. Likewise, |policy|'s
        <a for="ARTUR policy">hash set</a> is either empty or all its values match the
        grammar "<a grammar>hash-algorithm</a>-<a grammar>hash-source</a>". Further, |policy|'s
        <a for="ARTUR policy">reporting group</a> is a string that matches the `token`
        grammar defined in [[RFC7230]].

    3.  Let |csp| be a new <a for="/" lt="policy">Content Security Policy</a> with an empty
        <a for="policy">directive set</a>, and a <a for="policy">disposition</a> of "`enforce`" if
        |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">reporting disposition</a> is "`enforce`", and
        "`report`" otherwise.

    4.  Let |script-src| be the string "`'strict-dynamic' `".

    5.  If |policy| has a <a for="ARTUR policy">eval policy</a> of "`unsafe-allow`", then
        append "`'unsafe-eval' `" to |script-src|.

    6.  If |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">nonce</a> is not an empty string, append to
        |script-src| the result of replacing "`%s`" in the string "`'nonce-%s'` " with |policy|'s
        <a for="ARTUR policy">nonce</a>.

    7.  For each |digest| in |policy|'s <a for="ARTUR policy">hash set</a>:

        1.  Append to |script-src| the result of replacing "`%s`" in the string "`'%s'` " with
            |digest|.

    8.  Add a new <a>directive</a> to |csp|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> whose
        <a for="directive">name</a> is "`script-src`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is
        |script-src|.

    9.  Add a new <a>directive</a> to |csp|'s <a for="policy">directive set</a> whose
        <a for="directive">name</a> is "`object-src`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is
        "`'none'`".

        ISSUE: This probably needs to be somehow configurable.

    10. If |policy| has a <a for="ARTUR policy">reporting group</a> (|group|) which is not
        an empty string, then add a <a>directive</a> to |csp| whose <a for="directive">name</a>
        is "`report-to`", and whose <a for="directive">value</a> is |group|.

    11. Append |policy| to |response|'s <a for="response">CSP list</a>.


Implementation Considerations {#implementation}
=============================

Error Messages {#error-messages}
--------------

The <a http-header>`ARTUR`</a> mechanism is defined almost entirely in terms of [[CSP]].
This is intentional, as it means that user agents can easily reuse all the existing machinery
they've built up for that purpose. It might be confusing for developers, however, especially if,
in the distant future, CSP becomes an esoteric thing that no one uses on its own. Error messages,
in particular, might be confusing if they contain the synthesized CSP headers rather than the
headers the developer actually sent.

That is, violation report console messages might look something like "Refused to execute inline
event handler because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: '`script-src
'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-abcdefg'` ...". That is <em>technically</em> accurate (the best kind of
accurate), but not particularly helpful.

User agents SHOULD ensure that the source of the policy is clear when triggering violations.

ISSUE: Perhaps we should even extend the {{SecurityPolicyViolationEvent}} and corresponding
violation report?

Acknowledgements {#acks}
